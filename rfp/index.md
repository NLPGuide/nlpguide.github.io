### Visualisation / Interpretability

Visualise/interpet a text classification model's predictions 1) on a row/sentence 2) in aggregate for a model and dataset 3) across models differing by epochs or other hyperparameters

Visualise/interpet a seq2seq model's output 1) on a row/sentence 2) in aggregate for a model and dataset 3) across models differing by epochs or other hyperparameters

Modify fastText `test` to list out rows from the test set that were most strongly assigned each label, the rows most strongly assigned the wrong label, and the rows barely assigned a label
