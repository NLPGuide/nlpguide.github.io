# How to get top platforms to support your language

The optimum course of action depends on your goal.
Getting support for speech recognition, translation and something yet to be invented are very different.
Here we will mention basic things that you should do for almost all core features on all platforms.

## Get an ISO code

Does your language have an ISO code?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes

## Contribute text

How much raw unstructured text exists in your language?

Many models and techniques for many features on many platforms can make powerful use of raw unstructured text.

The most important corpus is still **Wikipedia**.  If your language does not have a large enough Wikipedia, it will not get included in many basic building blocks,
like fastText pretrained vectors, language identification or BERT.
Without language identification, it will not be included in other datasets needed for important tasks, like translation.

A few other important open unstructured corpora are Twitter, Reddit, Wikipedia-associated projects like Wikibooks, and the Bible.
There are also less open corpora like news, the UN documents and EuroParl that are often used.

It could be that text exists, but they are not in a machine-readable format, or not identified as that language.
